- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @My31ren
- ðŸ‘€ I'm working as a postdoc in Emory University. I have interests using advanced biostatistics as well as machine learning algorithms to really understand how environmental exposures contribute to human health. 
- ðŸŒ± I'm proficient in R and SAS, with extra interests in Python.
- Welcome to connect, and collaborate!

My31ren/My31ren is just my private repository for storing my learning note on R/SAS codes, as well as code/output files for my research papers published.
